Business Rules

BR001 — Initial card draw
After determining player order, each player must shuffle and draw 5 cards. If a player doesn’t like their hand, they can discard it, shuffle, and draw another hand of 5 cards.

BR002 — Card placements in the first two turns
For the first two turns, each player will lay only one card on the table

BR003 — Game area
The game area’s size for a 1v1 (2 player versus) game is 7x7. If a line card reaches the end of the area, the line can continue through the opposite side.

BR004 — Start cards
Each player has a start card. They are placed down at the beginning of the game, in the same orientation, with a square of distance between them.

BR005 — Player order (start)
To determine who goes first, the players will reveal a card from the top of their deck pile. Whoever’s card has the lower initiative number is the one who starts.

BR006 — Energy card usage
The energy card can be used once per round, starting from the third. They can freely choose between four effects. All players start with 3 energy points.

BR007 — Boost
Consume energy to place 3 cards (instead of 2).

BR008 — Break
Consume energy to place 1 card (instead of 2).

BR009 — Turn around
Consume energy to place a line card next to an exit point of a card you’ve placed previously (not the last one).

BR010 — Extra gas
Consume energy to draw an extra line card.
BR011 — Card draws
At the beginning of each round, players with less than 5 cards in their hand must draw until they have 5 cards in their hand.

BR012 — Endgame
A player loses when they cannot place another line card down on the table. If so, their opponent wins.

BR013 — Player order (during)
After the first round, the player whose card placed during the previous round has the lowest initiative number, is the one who will play first in this round.
